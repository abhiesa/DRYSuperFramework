# DRY Super Framework

This project is a DRY principle implementation inspired by [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
and [Swagger](https://swagger.io/), based on these parts:

* **Configuration:** using YAML and convention-over-configuration to define model metadata
* **Generators:** using Python/Cog to generate JPA from YAML
* **Backend:** using Java/Spring-Boot and JPA/Repository to perform the REST/CRUD operations with permissions
* **Front-end:** using TypeScript/Angular2/Material for the dynamic administration UI
* **Test:** using Python/requests and Selenium for REST/UI testing
