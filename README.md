# DRY Super Framework

This project is a DRY principle implementation inspired by [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
and [Swagger](https://swagger.io/), based on three parts:

* **Configuration:** using YAML and convention-over-configuration to define model metadata
* **Backend:** using Java/Spring-Boot and JPA generated from YAML to perform the CRUD operations with permissions
* **Front-end** using TypeScript/Angular2/Material for the dynamic administration UI
